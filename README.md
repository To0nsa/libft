**[üìö View full documentation](https://to0nsa.github.io/libft/)**

This C library was developed during my training at **42/Hive School** and has grown over time into a practical, reusable toolkit. It includes a wide range of utilities for **string, array, 2Darray** manipulation, **memory management**, **data structures**, **math**, and **custom I/O** ‚Äî all written from scratch in C.

By reimplementing core functions like `printf` and `qsort`, I deepened my understanding of **low-level programming**, **pointer logic**, and **performance optimization**. Each function was added to solve real challenges I encountered, helping me develop a strong foundation in writing **robust**, **readable**, **reusable** and **maintainable** code.

Special care was given to **error handling**, **code clarity**, **project structure** and **building documentation**. The library is organized, well-documented, and designed for **portability** across UNIX-like systems.

In addition to replicating standard behaviors, Libft introduces **custom tools** not found in the C standard library ‚Äî giving **greater flexibility** and **control** in real-world use cases. It promotes **code reusability** and can be easily integrated into new or existing C projects.

## Libft Features

<details>
<summary><strong>see features</strong></summary>

Libft is a foundational C library that offers a comprehensive toolkit for low-level programming. It emphasizes **performance**, **reliability**, and **clarity**, making it a solid base for building larger software systems.

**üîê Memory-Safe Operations**
All functions are implemented with a strong focus on memory safety. This includes careful handling of buffer boundaries, null-terminated strings, and dynamic memory allocation to prevent common pitfalls like buffer overflows or memory leaks.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Consistent Error Handling**
Functions gracefully handle edge cases and failure scenarios, such as null inputs or allocation errors. Return values are designed to be predictable and easily checkable, reducing the risk of undefined behavior.

**üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Design**
Every function is built to fail safely. This defensive approach ensures that developers can integrate Libft into their codebases without introducing instability or hidden bugs.

**üìò Solid Documentation**
Each module is thoroughly documented using Doxygen, with clear descriptions, usage guidelines, and grouping by functionality. This makes the library easy to navigate, understand, and maintain‚Äîeven as it grows in complexity.

**üß™ Tested and Modular**
Each component of the library is modular, making it easy to maintain, extend, or integrate into larger projects. The code follows clear conventions to support readability and maintainability.

**üìö Educational and Practical**
Originally designed as an educational exercise, Libft serves both as a learning tool and a practical foundation for writing robust C programs without relying on the standard library in constrained environments.

<summary><strong>üìö String</strong></summary>


- **Memory Safety**: Functions like `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, and `ft_strcat` ensure safe copying, avoiding buffer overflows or unintentional memory corruption.
- **Error Handling**: Most functions, especially those dealing with dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `ft_strdup`), gracefully handle errors such as memory allocation failures, returning `NULL` when necessary.
- **String Manipulation**:
  - Functions like `ft_strjoin` allow concatenation of strings while managing memory efficiently.
  - `ft_strtrim` helps remove unwanted characters from both ends of a string, useful for sanitizing input.
  - `ft_split` splits a string by a delimiter (usually a character) and returns an array of substrings. It's ideal for parsing inputs like CSV or space-separated values.
  - `ft_split_charset` splits a string based on any set of characters from a given charset, providing a more flexible solution for splitting strings with multiple delimiters or special characters.
- **Comparison**: String comparison functions like `ft_strcmp` and `ft_strncmp` provide reliable ways to compare strings, supporting various use cases such as lexicographical sorting or equality checks.
- **Copying and Duplication**: Functions like `ft_strncpy` and `ft_strdup` allow for secure string copying and duplication, handling edge cases like null-terminated strings or fixed-size buffers.
- **Error-proof Design**: Each utility function is designed to return consistent results while minimizing the risk of **undefined behavior** (null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflow...).
