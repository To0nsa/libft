This C library was developed during my training at **42/Hive School** and has grown over time into a practical, reusable toolkit. It includes a wide range of utilities for **string manipulation**, **memory management**, **data structures**, **math**, and **custom I/O** — all written from scratch in C.

By reimplementing core functions like `printf` and `qsort`, I deepened my understanding of **low-level programming**, **pointer logic**, and **performance optimization**. Each function was added to solve real challenges I encountered, helping me develop a strong foundation in writing **robust**, **readable**, and **maintainable** code.

Special care was given to **error handling**, **code clarity**, and **project structure**. The library is organized, well-documented, and designed for **portability** across UNIX-like systems.

In addition to replicating standard behaviors, Libft introduces **custom tools** not found in the C standard library — giving **greater flexibility** and **control** in real-world use cases. It promotes **code reusability** and can be easily integrated into new or existing C projects.

## Libft Features

<details>
<summary><strong>📚 String</strong></summary>

Libft provides a robust set of functions designed to handle common string operations, such as copying, joining, trimming, splitting, and comparing strings. Each function is carefully crafted to ensure efficient and reliable handling of string data, with a focus on **error handling** and **memory safety**.

**Features:**
- **Memory Safety**: Functions like `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, and `ft_strcat` ensure safe copying, avoiding buffer overflows or unintentional memory corruption.
- **Error Handling**: Most functions, especially those dealing with dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `ft_strdup`), gracefully handle errors such as memory allocation failures, returning `NULL` when necessary.
- **String Manipulation**:
  - Functions like `ft_strjoin` allow concatenation of strings while managing memory efficiently.
  - `ft_strtrim` helps remove unwanted characters from both ends of a string, useful for sanitizing input.
  - `ft_split` splits a string by a delimiter (usually a character) and returns an array of substrings. It's ideal for parsing inputs like CSV or space-separated values.
  - `ft_split_charset` splits a string based on any set of characters from a given charset, providing a more flexible solution for splitting strings with multiple delimiters or special characters.
- **Comparison**: String comparison functions like `ft_strcmp` and `ft_strncmp` provide reliable ways to compare strings, supporting various use cases such as lexicographical sorting or equality checks.
- **Copying and Duplication**: Functions like `ft_strncpy` and `ft_strdup` allow for secure string copying and duplication, handling edge cases like null-terminated strings or fixed-size buffers.
- **Error-proof Design**: Each utility function is designed to return consistent results while minimizing the risk of **undefined behavior** (null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflow...).
